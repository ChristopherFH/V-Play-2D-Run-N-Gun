# V-Play-2D-Run-N-Gun

## Project Structure
assets are splitted in serveral folders:
- audio (for sounds)
- font (for custom fonts)
- img (images and spritesheets) splitted in:
    - background
    - clouds
    - hud
    - tiles

the source code is split into serveral parts (some parts are in the wrong folders but due to refactoring issues we were not able to move them properly into different folders):
-   scenes: containing the three different scenes of the game (menu, highscore, game) and the HUD elements they need
-   entities: containing all elements which are spawned dynamically in the game (ground elements should be there too but refactoring broke the android build)
-   common: basically all items which are managing some part of the game (clouds, ground, data storing, etc.)

## Responsibilities

### Christopher KÃ¶llner
- Menu
- Highscore (Persistent Storage)

### Matthias Ringwald
- Ground, cloud, enemy generation (level generation)
- Player controls
- Camera behaviour
